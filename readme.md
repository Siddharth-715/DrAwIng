## Introduction

DrAwIng leverages machine learning techniques to classify hand-drawn sketches into various categories. It utilizes a trained model to predict the object being drawn based on the input sketch. The project provides an interactive interface for users to draw their sketches and receive predictions.

The core idea behind DrAwIng is to make the process of sketch classification accessible to a wider audience and encourage experimentation with machine learning algorithms. By building upon the work of the QuickDraw repository, this project aims to expand on its capabilities and provide a foundation for further development.

## Installation
